<div id="normal" class="row">
    <H4>This site is dedicated to connecting those who write about video games, the games industry, and game development with more readers.</H4>
    <p>Over the past few years we’ve seen a systemic undervaluing in editorial content. Many of the industries outlets have been shuttered whilst those that remain, only remain in business by creating mass-produced SEO friendly content. I’ve watched as many of my favourite writers have lost their jobs, or have been pushed into non-writing roles just to stay in the industry they love. However, the editorial content is still being made, it’s just not coming from large corporate owned sites. Many of our industries best writers now have blogs, patreons, and substack’s. Some write for free, whilst others need crowd funding to pay the bills. Meanwhile, up-and-coming writers no longer have a pathway into a viable career. These writers are left either penning their own blog on the side just to keep their passion going, or submitting their work to volunteer driven sites.</p>
    <p>The problem surrounding all of these amazing writers is, discovery. Alongside the crash of games writing, is also the crash of the traditional social media channels that used to be a reliable driver for discovering great pieces of writing. I made this site so that I can rectify this shift and reconnect the industries best writers with the readers who are interested in this content.</p>
    <p>I want those who rely on crowdfunding to be given the opportunity to prove to a new audience why their work is worth the small amount of money that they are asking for. I want more people to be able to read what our greatest writers have to say as they often are key drivers in shaping and improving the culture and education of our industry. And lastly I want those up-and-coming writers to be able to get a chance to show off their work to a bigger audience, hopefully enabling them to grow their writing into whatever direction helps them meet their goals. </p>
    <p>This site is my way of giving back to the community of writers whose words have moved me, educated me, and delighted me over the past few years, and hopefully many more years to come.</p>
